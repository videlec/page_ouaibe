  "abstract": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity\">Self-similar</a> dynamical systems are example of highly structured dynamical systems. But there are much more systems of low complexity. One way to consider all of them is to slightly weaken the notion of self-similarity: we allow to see different patterns at different scales but all of them belong to a fixed family. The combinatorial counterpart of this construction are the so-called S-adic systems."

   "abstract": "The wind-tree model is a billiard in the plane where scatterers are rectangles randomly displaced. We study a periodic version and prove that the diffusion rate is 2/3. More precisely the maximum distance reached by a particule before time T is around T^(2/3). It makes a large difference with random walks in the plane for which that quantity equals T^(1/2)."
